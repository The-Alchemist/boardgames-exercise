; # Modeling Chess: Introduction
;;
;; ---
;; 1. [Welcome](./welcome)
;; 1. Introduction üëà __you are here__
;; 1. [Code Walkthrough 1](./walkthrough): Let's get started. Basic modeling of board and pieces.
;; ---
;;
;; ### Background story
;;
;; * I was helping undergraduate students with a coding exercise about modeling
;; the game of Chess. Many of them getting trapped in class-based OO
;; design (using Java or Kotlin). Days later:
;;
;; * I re-started reading book _"Software Design for
;; Flexibility_".[^sdff_book] Coincidentally, chapter _2.4 "Abstracting a
;; Domain"_ models the game of Checkers. It then proceeds to abstract a core
;; domain, and leaves the implement the rules of Chess as an exercise.
;; [^sdff_book]: by Chris Hanson and Gerald Jay Sussman ![image](https://mit-press-us.imgix.net/covers/9780262045490.jpg?auto=format&w=298&dpr=2&q=80)
;;
;; Soon after, I found myself working on the exercise, hoping to achieve a
;; simple solution using basic functional programming concepts. These notebooks
;; are my attempt at documenting it.
;;
;; The goal of this exercise is pedagogical: to learn software design concepts,
;; touching upon the basics of topics such us:
;;
;; * Functional programming
;; * Immutability
;; * Literate programming
;; * Interactive (and "moldable") development
;; * Data-orientation
;; * Stratified design
;; * Simplicity
;; * some Testing techniques
;; * and some Clojure
;;
;; ### "Why Clojure? I wished you used _&lt;JavaScript/Python/...&gt;_"
;;
;; Why not? Clojure is a simple functional language, ideal for my goal... and I
;; like it üôÇ.
;;
;; If you don't know Clojure:
;;
;;   * I hope the code is not too hard to follow. I tried to use only basic
;; features of the language, and no external library depedencies
;;   * Hey, this might be a good opportunity for you to learn and try Clojure!
;;   * If you don't want to use Clojure, that's fine too: I'd encourage you to
;; re-implement this exercise in your favorite language as you follow the code
;; walkthrough.
;;
;; ### Clojure code-stepping debugger
;;
;; Let's first define a function `hello-message` that receives a `name` (String) and returns a `"Hello ... !"` message (String):

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
(defn hello-message [name]
  (str "Hello " name "!"))

;; If you are new to Lisp languages, the biggest syntax difference is in the way
;; you call a function: on C/JavaScript-like syntax you write: `functionName(arg1,
;; arg2, ...)`, while in Lisp/Clojure you write: `(function-name arg1 arg2 ...)` instead.
;;
;; If you are new to Lisp languages, the biggest syntax difference is in the way
;; you call a function:[^lisp_simplification]
;; * in C/JavaScript-like syntax: `functionName(arg1, arg2, ...)`
;; * in Lisp/Clojure syntax: `(function-name arg1 arg2 ...)`
;; [^lisp_simplification]: an over-simplification off-course, but not a lie
;;
;; Here's an expression that calls the above function passing `"World"`, which evaluates to, you guessed it, `"Hello World!"`:
^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :show}}
(hello-message "World")

;;
;; To make some code snippets easier to follow on these notebooks, I worked on a code viewer that let's you step through the code execution (back and forth).[^flowstorm]
;; [^flowstorm]: Based on the (amazing!) [FlowStorm](https://www.flow-storm.org/) by [jpmonettas](https://github.com/sponsors/jpmonettas) ![](https://github.com/flow-storm/flow-storm-debugger/raw/master/docs/images/icon.png)

#_ "I'm sorry if you favorite language doesn't have something like it. Just wait... every good thing from Lisp/Clojure finds its way into other languages, only decades later ;-)"

;;
;; Given the function above, let's evaluate the following code snippet, which:
;; 1. first calls that function passing `"World"`, and then
;; 2. repeats the result (returned by function `hello-message`) ten times, evaluating to a sequence:

^{::clerk/visibility {:code :hide :result :show}
  ::clerk/width :wide
  ::clerk/viewer clerk-storm/timeline-stepper-viewer}
(clerk-storm/show-trace {:include-fn-names []}
  (repeat 10 (hello-message "World"))
  #_(let [msg (hello-message "World")]
    (repeat 10 msg)))
