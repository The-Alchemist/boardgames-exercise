; # Modeling Chess: Closing Thoughts

;; I really hope you enjoyed this walkthough! I had a lot of fun working on
;; it. I hope you learned something new from it, or that at that least I triggered
;; your curiosity.

;; ## Look Ma! No classes!

;; One of the goals when I started implementing this was to show a simple
;; _functional_ approach to modeling the problem, contrasting it with a more
;; common class-based object-oriented design.
;;
;; The implementation uses no mutation at all, there are no variables.
;
;; There are no classes. And we declared no Types.
;;
;; Note: I'm not against types. Actually, I once in a while miss a good
;; type-checker when working in Clojure. The point I'm trying to make is that
;; types are not at the _core_ of functional programing: data-first, immutability, pure
;; functions, and treating functions as values are.

;; ## Data-Orientation

;; The way we've modeled the problem is by defining the shape of data, and ways to transform it. That's pretty much it.
;;
;; **Data > Code**: Prefer data to code. Look at our rule functions: as
;; implemented, they are very close to being just _data_ too: a good next step
;; could be to define a structure to express expansion rules as data (given a
;; rich set of primitives). Then we could read the rules from configuration
;; files (yaml, xml, json or edn), or a database, allowing end users to define
;; new pieces and games.
