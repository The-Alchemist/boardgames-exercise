;; # Coding Exercise: Modeling Chess
;;
;;
;;  > __Assignment__: Model the rules of Chess. Design the code with the
;;  flexibility to easily add new types of pieces with unique movements. The
;;  goal is to create a shared core model that can also be used for other
;;  board games, such as Checkers, Tic-Tac-Toe, and similar.
;;
;; <!-- **TL;DR**: Jump straight to the [code walkthrough](./notebooks/walkthrough).-->
;;
;;
;; What started as a whiteboard discussion sent me down a rabbit-hole to attempt a functional and (hopefully) simple implementation... then document it, then prepare it for a presentation, add visualizations, notebooks, implement a better code viewer... üê∞üï≥Ô∏è
;;
;; Anyway... here's what I have so far, as a handful of notebooks:[^skip-intro]
;; [^skip-intro]: Pro-tip: skip the Introduction
;;
;; 1. [Introduction](./notebooks/intro): Why!? Some more background. Goal. On Clojure
;; 1. [Code Walkthrough](./notebooks/walkthrough): Let's start: Modeling the board and pieces
;; 1. [Code Walkthrough 2](./notebooks/walkthrough2): TBD: The crux of it: valid moves
;; 1. [Code Walkthrough 2](./notebooks/walkthrough4): TBD: ??? More on Testing ???
;; 1. [Code Walkthrough 2](./notebooks/walkthrough5): TBD: ??? Other non-chess games ???
;; 1. [Closing](./notebooks/closing): Pending ideas, some conclusions and recommended readings
