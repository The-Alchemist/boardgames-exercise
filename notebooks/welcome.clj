;; # Coding Exercise: Modeling Chess
;;
;;
;;  __Assignment__: Model the rules of Chess. Design the code with the
;;  flexibility to easily add new types of pieces with unique movements. The
;;  goal is to create a shared core model that can also be used for other
;;  board games, such as Checkers, Tic-Tac-Toe, and similar. \
;;  \
;; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Spoiler Alert** ‚ö†Ô∏è: This is a solution to exercise 2.13 of book _"Software Design for
;; Flexibility."_[^sdff_book] \
;; \
;; üê∞üï≥Ô∏è  What started as a whiteboard discussion sent me down a rabbit-hole to attempt
;; a functional and (hopefully) simple implementation... then document it, then
;; prepare it for a presentation, add visualizations, notebooks, implement a
;; better code viewer, ...
