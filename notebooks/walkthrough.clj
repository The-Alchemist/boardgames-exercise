;; # Exercise in modeling grid-board games
;;
;; I started this little "project" after the following two events happened the
;; same week:
;;
;; * I was helping Software Engineering students with an exercise in modeling
;; Chess games and variations. Most of them using Java.
;;
;; * I read chapter 2.4 "Abstracting a Domain" from the book "Software Design
;; for Flexibility" (by Chris Hanson and Gerald Jay Sussman). Which,
;; coincidentally, models the game of Checkers and asks to extend it to Chess as
;; an exercise.

#_ (comment
;; we aim to model
;; the game of chess, by creating a core model that can also be used to
;; implement other board games like tic-tac-toe, checkers and variations of
;; chess.
     )

;; ## Problem statement
;;
;; Model the game of chess.  Make the model flexible so that chess
;; variations can also be implemented (for example, defining special pieces with new movements). Design it so
;; that a core of the model can be used to implement other board games, such as
;; Checkers, Tic-Tac-Toe and the like.
;;
;; ## Goal
;;
;; The goal of this exercise is purely pedagogical: to learn and teach some
;; software design concepts, covering the basics of topics such us:
;;
;; * Functional programming
;; * Literate programming
;; * Interactive (and "moldable") development
;; * Data-orientation
;; * Simplicity
;; * Stratified design
;; * Immutability
;; * Clojure
;;

;;
;; ## Code organization
;;
;; Other than Clerk itself, the code has *no* library depedencies, not even for
;; the graphical widgets to visualize the boards on this notebook. I also tried
;; to use only basic features of Clojure (no managed refs, multimethods,
;; protocols, transducers).
;;
;; This notebook below is a high-level walkthrough of the implementation.
;;
;; The code is organized in the following namespaces:

;; |namespace | description|
;; |----------|------------|
;; |[clerk-viewers](/src/boardgames/clerk_viewers) | The graphical widgets to visualize boards and moves on Clerk notebooks |
;; |[core](/src/boardgames/core/) | generic domain to model board games|
;; |[chess](/src/boardgames/chess/) | implementation of classic Chess (WIP)|
;; |[checkers](/src/boardgames/checkers) | implementation of Checkers (_TBD_) |
;; |[ttt](/src/boardgames/ttt) | implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe  (_TBD_) |

;; ## How to model a board? Where do we start?

;; Let's start with the simplest data structure that could represent the problem
;; at hand. In this case, I with a `board` data structure as vector of
;; vectors (a matrix), like so:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
(def board-1 '[[r n b q k b n r]
               [p p p p p p p p]
               [- - - - - - - -]
               [- - - - - - - -]
               [- - - - - - - -]
               [- - - - - - - -]
               [P P P P P P P P]
               [R N B Q K B N R]] )

;; Do you see it? With some imagination, that's a chess board at starting
;; position ğŸ™‚. Each element is either a piece or an empty square. I chose
;; single letters instead of words to make the board easier to visualize. Upper
;; case for white pieces, lower case for black.[^no_commas]
;;
;; [^no_commas]: a nice thing about Clojure is that you don't need commas to
;; separate elements of a vector or list.
;;
;; That example above uses Clojure _symbols_. I could have used chars, or keywords
;; instead. The latter being the most idiomatic:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
(def board-2 [[:r :n :b :q :k :b :n :r]
              [:p :p :p :p :p :p :p :p]
              [:- :- :- :- :- :- :- :-]
              [:- :- :- :- :- :- :- :-]
              [:- :- :- :- :- :- :- :-]
              [:- :- :- :- :- :- :- :-]
              [:P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P]
              [:R :N :B :Q :K :B :N :R]])

;; One point in favor of keywords is that the literal board doesn't have to be
;; quoted (like symbols do, to avoid evaluation). A point for symbols is that
;; it's easier on the eyes... I'll stick with symbols.
;;
;; It's nice to make it easy to create literal board positions. It's also trivial to
;; get the piece at a given position coordinate:

(get-in board-1 [0 0])

(get-in board-1 [7 4])

;; Now... _position_ is just one attribute of a piece. Here we rely on the
;; letter's case (upper or lower) to represent the color (player actually, for
;; chess) but other games might need more than 2 colors... and we'll surely need
;; other attributes, like whether the piece has been moved or not. So, the above
;; representation is handy, yes... and very limited.

;; I ended up representing the board as map, with its dimensions and its set of
;; pieces. This would be an empty 8x8 board:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
{:pieces #{}, :row-n 3, :col-n 3}

;; The value on the `:pieces` key is a set of pieces, where each piece is a map
;; with its attributes. Here's an example of a board with a few pieces:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
{:pieces #{{:type :k, :player 0, :pos [4 2], :flags #{}}
           {:type :p, :player 0, :pos [4 3], :flags #{}}
           {:type :p, :player 1, :pos [3 4], :flags #{}}
           {:type :k, :player 1, :pos [3 5], :flags #{}}}
 :row-n 8
 :col-n 8}

;; * `:type` is the piece type (like `:k` for king, `:p` for pawn). We could use long names here
;; * `:player` is the player number (0 or 1 for chess). This leaves open the possibility of more than 2 players
;; * `:pos` the position of the piece on the board. The origin `[0 0]` being the bottom-left square. Side-effect: this allows for
;;   having more than one piece on the same square (if some game needs that)[^identical-piece-on-set]
;; * `:flags` a set of flags to attach to the piece (like, `:moved?`, or whatever each specific game might need)
;;
;; [^identical-piece-on-set]: Well, ok ok: two totally identical pieces wouldn't
;; be allowed on a Set (dupes aren't allowed)... but I won't over-complicate it
;; for now
;;

;; The `core` namespace is the generic domain for board games. It's not game-specific.
;; Function `core/empty-board` creates a board with the given dimensions:

(core/empty-board 3 3)


;; ## Visualizing our domain

;; Let's write and use a specialized viewer to visualize our boards:
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-board-viewer}
(core/empty-board 3 3)

^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-board-viewer}
(core/empty-board 8 8)

;; That's the idea behind [Clerk](https://book.clerk.vision): build specialized
;; viewers and interactive tools to make your code and data easier to work with
;; and explain.
;;
;; Let's create a standard chess board on its starting possition. We use
;; function `initialize-chess-board` from the `chess` namespace.  Now using
;; a "tabbed" viewer to switch between the plain data structure and the visual
;; board:

^{::clerk/viewer viewers/tabbed-board-viewer
  ::clerk/auto-expand-results? true }
(def a-chess-board (chess/initiate-chess-board))



;; ## Alternate representations

;; Our new board structure is more flexible, and we have nice graphical
;; viewers... but I still I miss the simple matrix represation: It's good to
;; have an easy way to express _literal_ boards without the whole data
;; structure with all those details...  specially when working at the REPL, or
;; writing unit tests.
;;
;; How about we write a function for that? That's function `core/symbolic->board` : it
;; converts our simple matrix to our richer boards. Let's initialize a board
;; from a symbolic literal value:
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-board-viewer ::clerk/auto-expand-results? true }
(core/symbolic->board '[[- - - - - - - -]
                        [- - - - - - - -]
                        [- - - k - - - -]
                        [- - - p - - - -]
                        [- - - - P - - -]
                        [- - - - K - - -]
                        [- - - - - - - -]
                        [- - - - - - - -]])


;; And we can go the opposite direction with `core/board->symbolic`, which
;; converts a board structure to a simplified symbolic representation:
(def symboard (core/board->symbolic a-chess-board))


;; This technique of having another an alternate representation for an domain
;; entity is quite common and useful in other cases too. What if we want to
;; shuffle all the pieces on the board? With the matrix representation it's
;; easy to manipulate the board using Clojure's standard functions:
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/tabbed-board-viewer}
(def a-random-board (->> symboard
                         (apply concat)
                         shuffle
                         (partition (count symboard))
                         core/symbolic->board))


;; And how about Fisher-style shuffling?  That is: we shuffle only the first
;; row, and the last row must be its mirror, so that both players start from an "equal" position:
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/tabbed-board-viewer}
(let [first-row (shuffle (first symboard))
      last-row (->> first-row (mapv utils/upper-case-keyword))]
  (-> symboard
      (assoc 0 first-row)
      (assoc (dec (count symboard)) last-row)
      core/symbolic->board))

;; ## Moving pieces

;; This is the core problem of this domain: How to decide which moves are
;; valid?. Actually, it's better to model the problem as that of generating
;; valid moves. So, the question becomes:
;;
;; > _How do we generate all valid moves given a board possition?_
;;
;; In the case of chess, the valid moves for a piece depend on its type. So we'd
;; like to have a way to code the move-generation logic independently for each
;; piece type. However, some of them share similar characteristics (moves on
;; diagonals, or orthogonal, cannot go over other pieces, captures opponent
;; pieces, etc.), so it'd be nice to code this "behaviors" separately and
;; combine them to model each one of the piece types.
;;
;;
;; ### Generating possible (valid) moves
;;
;; Before we dig into how to generate the moves, let's see how we'll represent such moves.
;;
;; We model a move as a list of (one or more) _steps_. Each step includes the piece
;; it affects and the resulting board state. The very first step represents the
;; board position at the start of this move.
;;
;; While generating possible moves, a move is grown (or _expanded_) one step at
;; a time, forming a tree. We'll refer to them as `pmoves` (for "partial
;; moves").  A `pmove` that is not `:finished?` may be expanded with more steps
;; until it is either discarded (a dead-end, with no valid options) or it
;; becomes `:finished?`.
;;
;; Let's create an initial `pmove`, for the Rook in position `[0 0]` (using a
;; small board here to keep the noise low):
;;
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-move-viewer}
(core/new-pmove (core/symbolic->board '[[r - k]
                                        [- - -]
                                        [R - K]])
                {:type :R, :player 0, :pos [0 0]})

;; That's a new partial-move, containing only its starting board (step zero),
;; and thus it is (obviously) not `:finished`. The move-generation functions
;; take this pmove and return a collection of (zero or more) new pmoves, each
;; with an extra step, until we exhaust all options and we keep the `:finished`
;; ones.
;;
;; Here's an example of one of the final generated moves for the rook above:
^{::clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :show}
  ::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-move-viewer}
(first (let [game (core/start-game chess/chess-game
                                   (core/symbolic->board '[[r - k]
                                                           [- - -]
                                                           [R - K]]))]
         (->> game
              core/possible-pmoves
              (filter (fn [pmove] (= [0 2] (-> pmove :steps first :piece :pos)))))))


;; It contains three steps, as we move the `R`ook from position `[0 0]` to `[0
;; 2]`. Note that the last step also records the capturing of a piece (a pawn).

;; TBD

;; We want to model a shared core, which we can use on any game. Let's work on
;; the model for moves and their generation.

;;
;; ## Simple Tests
;; ### TBD

;;
;; # ********* DRAFT SKETCH NOTES *********
;;
;; ## OK. Let's start chess game...
(def game-1 (core/start-game chess/chess-game))

;; Get me all possible moves...
          (count (core/possible-pmoves game-1))

;; Let's take a look at a couple of moves returned:
^{::clerk/viewer clerk-viewer/map-viewer
::clerk/auto-expand-results? true}
(first (core/possible-pmoves game-1))

^{::clerk/viewer clerk-viewer/map-viewer
  ::clerk/auto-expand-results? true}
(second (core/possible-pmoves game-1))

;; So, a move contains a list of `:steps`. Each step includes the piece it
;; applies to and a snapshot of the board. The very first step is the initial board.
;;
;; The idea of modeling moves as a list of steps will make sense when you dig
;; into the implementation of `core/possible-moves`.

;; Let's sort all the possible moves by piece x-coordinate, and show them visually:
(clerk/row (sort-by #(-> % :steps first :piece :pos first)
                        (core/possible-pmoves game-1)))

;; Just for kicks, let's start off the random board create above
(def a-random-game
  (core/start-game chess/chess-game a-random-board))

;; Get all possible Rook moves:
(clerk/row
 (->>  (core/possible-pmoves a-random-game)
       (filter (fn [pmove] (= :r (-> pmove :steps last :piece :type))))))


#_(clerk/row  (->> (core/possible-pmoves a-random-game)
                 (map (comp :board first :steps))))




#_(clerk/row (map #(-> % :steps first :board core/board->symbolic) (take 2 (core/possible-pmoves game-1))))
#_(-> (first (core/possible-pmoves game-1)) :steps last :piece :pos)

#_(clerk/row
   (map #_#(update-in % [:steps] reverse)
    #(first (:steps %))

    (filter (fn [pmove]
              (= [1 1] (-> pmove :steps last :piece :pos)))
            (core/possible-pmoves game-1))))
