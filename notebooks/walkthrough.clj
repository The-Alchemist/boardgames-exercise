;; ## How can we model a board?

;; We want to model a board for grid-based games (like chess or
;; checkers). The pieces can be of different types (pawn, rook, etc.) and
;; colors. Each piece has a position on the board.
;;
;; Let's start with the simplest data structure to represent the problem. We can
;; model a `board` simply as a vector of vectors (a matrix?), like so:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
(def board-1 '[[r n b q k b n r]
               [p p p p p p p p]
               [- - - - - - - -]
               [- - - - - - - -]
               [- - - - - - - -]
               [- - - - - - - -]
               [P P P P P P P P]
               [R N B Q K B N R]])

;; Do you see it? With some imagination, that's a chess board at starting
;; position ğŸ™‚. Each element of the inner vectors is either a piece (a letter)
;; or an empty square (`-`). Upper case for white pieces, lower case for
;; black.[^no_commas]
;;
;; [^no_commas]: a nice thing about Clojure: you don't need commas to separate
;; elements of a vector or list.

;; That code defines a new _var_ named `board-1` to hold our vector of vectors of symbols.

;; Here we use Clojure _symbols_ for each piece. We could have used chars or
;; Clojure _keywords_ instead (which would've been more idiomatic). We'll stick
;; with symbols which are easier on the eyes.[^symbols_quoting]
;;
;; [^symbols_quoting]: NOTE: symbols are commonly used as names for
;; _variables_ (like `board-1` here). The single quote `'` char at the beginning
;; of the vector tells Clojure to take the following expression _literally_,
;; without trying to resolve symbols as variables. If this is confusing, never
;; mind: think of them as one-character "constants" here.

;; It's nice to have a way to express a board positions as a _literal_
;; expression like that. This representation also makes it trivial to get the
;; piece at a given position coordinate:

(get-in board-1 [0 0])

(get-in board-1 [7 4])

;; Now... What if we want to track more data about each piece?  _Position_ is
;; just one attribute of a piece, and here its implied by its location on the
;; vectors. To represent the color of each piece (player side actually) here we
;; rely on the letter's case (upper or lower), so we are limited to 2. Although
;; we don't want to over-design, we'll surely need other attributes to keep
;; track of, like whether the piece has been moved or not, which is needed in
;; Chess for certain moves.

;; So, the above representation is handy... and limited.  What if we just
;; represent pieces as maps[^clojure_maps], and the board as a map too?. The board would
;; initially include its dimensions and the set of pieces.  This would be an
;; empty 8x8 board:
;; [^clojure_maps]: a data structure to stores key-value pairs. Aka "dictionary", "hashmap", "associative array" in some languages

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}
  ::clerk/auto-expand-results? true}
{ :pieces #{}
  :row-n 3
  :col-n 3 }

;; The value on the `:pieces` key is a Set of pieces[^clojure-sets], where each piece is another Map
;; with its attributes. Here's another board with a few pieces:
;; [^clojure-sets]: Map literals are written like this in Clojure:  `{...}`. Set literals as: `#{...}`

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
{:pieces #{{:type :k, :player 0, :pos [4 2], :flags #{}}
           {:type :p, :player 0, :pos [4 3], :flags #{}}
           {:type :p, :player 1, :pos [3 4], :flags #{}}
           {:type :k, :player 1, :pos [3 5], :flags #{}}}
 :row-n 8
 :col-n 8}

;; * `:type` is the piece type (like `:k` for king, `:p` for pawn)
;; * `:player` is the player number (0 or 1 for chess). This leaves open the possibility of more than 2 players
;; * `:pos` the position of the piece on the board. The origin `[0 0]` being the bottom-left square.
;; * `:flags` a set of flags to attach to the piece (like, `:moved?`, or whatever each specific game might need)
;;
;; This representation is more flexible. We can attach any data we might need
;;   onto our pieces. For instance, if a game needs to keep track of pieces
;;   outside the board, we could do that by using special values on
;;   `:pos`... and we could potentially allow more than one piece on the same
;;   position[^identical-piece-on-set].
;; [^identical-piece-on-set]: Well, ok smart reader: two totally identical pieces wouldn't
;; be allowed on a Set (sets don't allow duplicates)... but we'll keep it simple for now
;;

;; We can write a trival function to create a board with the given dimensions. That's what `core/empty-board` does:

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
(defn new-board [pieces row-n col-n]
  {:pieces (set pieces)
   :row-n row-n
   :col-n col-n})

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
(defn empty-board [n-rows n-columns]
  (new-board #{} n-rows n-columns))

;; Create an empty 3x3 board:

(core/empty-board 3 3)

;; We'll use the [`core`](/src/boardgames/core/) namespace for the code that is generic about the domain
;; of grid games. And we'll use another namespace for each game, like [`chess`](/src/boardgames/chess/).

;;
;; ## Visualizing our domain
;;
;; Before going any further: Wouldn't it be nice to see a graphical representation of our boards?

;; That's the idea behind notebooks and [Clerk](https://book.clerk.vision) in
;; particular: to build specialized viewers for your problem domain, and
;; interactive tools to make your code and data easier to work with and
;; explain[^moldable].
;; [^moldable]: The big idea here is [Moldable
;; Development](https://moldabledevelopment.com/), a way of programming through
;; custom tools built for each problem.

;; So, I wrote a simple viewer to visualize our boards. Let's create a few empty
;; boards of different sizes to try it out. The resulting data structure renders
;; on the left, and a graphical view of it on the right:
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-board-viewer}
(core/empty-board 3 3)

^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-board-viewer}
(core/empty-board 2 8)

^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-board-viewer}
(core/empty-board 8 8)


;; We are not going to go into the boards rendering code right now. If you are curious, feel free to peek into the [`clerk-viewers`](../src/boardgames/clerk_viewers) namespace.[^clerk-viewers-impl]
;; [^clerk-viewers-impl]: Warning: the implementation of the viewers is a bit messy... needs some clean-up

;; Let's create one with a few pieces:
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-board-viewer}
(core/new-board 8 8 #{{:type :k, :player 0, :pos [4 2], :flags #{}}
                      {:type :p, :player 0, :pos [4 3], :flags #{}}
                      {:type :p, :player 1, :pos [3 4], :flags #{}}
                      {:type :k, :player 1, :pos [3 5], :flags #{}}} )


;; OK. What if we want to create a standard chess board on its starting
;; possition? That'd be pretty verbose with our new maps representation. It was
;; short and "visual" with the matrix representation we started with... not
;; anymore ğŸ˜•.

;; ## Alternate representations

;; Our new board structure is more flexible, and we now have graphical
;; viewers... but I still I miss the simple matrix syntax: It's good to have an
;; easy way to express _literal_ boards in code...
;; specially when working at the REPL, or writing unit tests.
;;
;; This is true for any problem domain: it's always good to make your code as
;; close as possible to the language of your domain.
;;
;; What if we had a function for that? I mean, let's write a function that
;; converts our original simple matrix to our newer richer structure for
;; boards. That's exactly what function `core/symbolic->board` does.
;;
;; Let's initialize a board just like our last one but from a symbolic literal value:
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-board-viewer ::clerk/auto-expand-results? true}
(core/symbolic->board '[[- - - - - - - -]
                        [- - - - - - - -]
                        [- - - k - - - -]
                        [- - - p - - - -]
                        [- - - - P - - -]
                        [- - - - K - - -]
                        [- - - - - - - -]
                        [- - - - - - - -]])

;; So now we can create a full Chess board at initial position from a compact representation:
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-board-viewer ::clerk/auto-expand-results? true}
(core/symbolic->board '[[r n b q k b n r]
                        [p p p p p p p p]
                        [- - - - - - - -]
                        [- - - - - - - -]
                        [- - - - - - - -]
                        [- - - - - - - -]
                        [P P P P P P P P]
                        [R N B Q K B N R]])


;;
;; Of course, we want to have a function for that: `chess/initialize-chess-board` (in the
;; [`chess`](/src/boardgames/chess/) namespace). Its implementation is almost exactly
;; like the last snippet above.
;;
;; Let's try it here:

^{::clerk/viewer viewers/tabbed-board-viewer
  ::clerk/auto-expand-results? true }
(def a-chess-board (chess/initiate-chess-board))

;;  Note that we are using a "tabbed" viewer this time, which lets you switch
;; between the plain data structure and the visual board.

;; Of course we'd also want to go the opposite direction, that is: convert a
;; board structure to the simplified symbolic representation. That's what
;; `core/board->symbolic` does. Here we convert the starting chess board
;; position we've just created back into a matrix:
^{::clerk/viewer clerk-viewer/code-viewer}
(def symboard (core/board->symbolic a-chess-board))


;; This technique of having another an alternate representation for an domain
;; entity is quite common and useful in many situations.

;; For example: What if we want to shuffle all the pieces on the board? With the
;; matrix representation it's easy to manipulate the pieces using Clojure's
;; standard functions... So: we take our rich initial chess board, convert it,
;; shuffle the pieces, and convert it back:
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/tabbed-board-viewer}
(def a-random-board (->> a-chess-board
                         core/board->symbolic
                         (apply concat)
                         shuffle
                         (partition (:row-n a-chess-board))
                         core/symbolic->board))


;; And how about Shuffle-chess style starting position?  That is: we shuffle only
;; the first row (behind the pawns), and the last row must be its mirror, so
;; that both players start from an "equal" army formation:[^fisher_style]
;; [^fisher_style]: I leave Fisher-style shuffle as an exercise for the reader:
;; we'd need to iterate on the shuffling until we get a position complying with
;; fisher's restrictions
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/tabbed-board-viewer}
(let [first-row (shuffle (first symboard))
      last-row (->> first-row (mapv utils/upper-case-keyword))]
  (-> symboard
      (assoc 0 first-row)
      (assoc (dec (count symboard)) last-row)
      core/symbolic->board))

;; ## Modeling Moves

;; We've been playing with pieces, boards and visualizations while avoiding the
;; real problem: that of modeling the rules of chess.[^procrast] In particular,
;; modeling piece moves. And how to decide which moves are valid?
;; [^procrast]: Was that procrastinating? or sharpening the axe? A bit of both?
;;
;; We'll tackle the problem as that of
;; _generating_ valid moves. So, the question becomes:
;;
;; > _How do we generate all valid moves given a board possition?_
;;
;; And this is the crux of this whole exercise.
;;
;; ### Representing Moves
;;
;; We will model a move as a simple map. Key `:steps` will contain a list
;; of (one or more) _steps_. Each step includes the piece it affects and the
;; resulting board state. The very first step represents the board position at
;; the start of this move.
;;
;; Here's a minimal example, using a board containing just two Rooks (using a
;; small 3x3 board just to save space). The move below represents moving
;; `:player` 0's Rook (`:r`) from `:pos [0 0]` (bottom-left corner) to `:pos [2
;; 0]. That's three steps: the initial position plus two steps to the right:

^{::clerk/visibility {:code :hide :result :show}
  ::clerk/auto-expand-results? true}
(def example-move
  {:steps
   (list
    {:board
     {:pieces
      #{{:type :r, :player 0, :pos [2 0], :flags #{}}
        {:type :r, :player 1, :pos [2 2], :flags #{}}},
      :row-n 3,
      :col-n 3},
     :piece {:type :R, :player 0, :pos [2 0]},
     :flags #{}}
    {:board #_(core/new-board 8 8 #{{:type :r, :player 0, :pos [1 0], :flags #{}}
                                  {:type :r, :player 1, :pos [7 7], :flags #{}}})
     {:pieces
        #{{:type :r, :player 0, :pos [1 0], :flags #{}}
          {:type :r, :player 1, :pos [2 2], :flags #{}}},
        :row-n 3,
        :col-n 3},
     :piece {:type :R, :player 0, :pos [1 0]},
     :flags #{}}
    {:board
     {:pieces
      #{{:type :r, :player 0, :pos [0 0], :flags #{}}
        {:type :r, :player 1, :pos [2 2], :flags #{}}},
      :row-n 3,
      :col-n 3},
     :piece {:type :R, :player 0, :pos [0 0]},
     :flags #{}})})

;;
;; Maybe it's easier to see if we render the boards within each step. You may click to expand:
;;
^{::clerk/visibility {:code :hide :result :show}
  ::clerk/auto-expand-results? true}
(clerk/with-viewers (concat [viewers/board-viewer] clerk/default-viewers)
  example-move)


;; And here we introduce a new viewer: one to show a move as a single board. Here's the same move again:

^{::clerk/viewer viewers/board-move-viewer
  ::clerk/visibility {:code :hide :result :show}}
example-move


;; ### Partial Moves

;; Moves will be constructed one step at a time. We start by creating a basic move
;; containing only the initial step (_step zero_, the starting position of the
;; move), and then we call a function to _expand_ the move (that is, to add a new step).

;; We'll call these "partial moves", `pmoves` for short.  A `pmove` that is not
;; `:finished?` is not yet a valid move, but may be expanded with more steps
;; until it is either discarded or it becomes `:finished?`.[^partial-moves-idea]
;
;; [^partial-moves-idea]: I stole this idea of "partial moves" from Chapter 2.4 of
;; _"Software Design for Flexibility"_ by Hanson and Sussman
;;
;; Let's create an initial `pmove` for the Rook in position `[0 0]` (using a
;; small 3x3 board here to just to save space):
;;
^{::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-move-viewer}
(core/new-pmove (core/symbolic->board '[[r - k]
                                        [- - -]
                                        [R - K]])
                {:type :R, :player 0, :pos [0 0]})

;; That's a new partial move, containing only the initial step with its starting
;; board (step zero), and thus it is (obviously) not `:finished`.
;;

;; ### Generating Move Steps
;;
;; Given the initial partial move above (for a Rook), we'd need a function that
;; appends a new steps, that is, _expands_ the `pmove`.
;;

;; ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”–  ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”–

;; ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”–  ğŸ”– ğŸ”– ğŸ”–

;; The core move-generation logic starts by calling the game-specific rules
;; functions with this initial pmove. Each rule function _expands_ this pmove by
;; returning a collection of (zero or more) new pmoves, each with an extra step added,
;; some of them `:finished`.
;;
;; The move-generation logic iterates over the rules functions again, passing
;; all the new pmoves that are not `:finished`, until we only have `:finished`
;; ones.
;;
;; Here's an example of one of the final generated moves for the rook above.  We
;; first start a game of chess from a given board position, obtain all possible
;; moves, and filter for the ones finishing on square `[0 2]` (top-right)
^{::clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :show}
  ::clerk/viewer viewers/side-by-side-move-viewer}
(let [game (core/start-game chess/chess-game
                            (core/symbolic->board '[[r - k]
                                                    [- - -]
                                                    [R - K]]))]
  (->> game
       core/possible-pmoves
       (filter (fn [pmove] (= [0 2] (-> pmove :steps first :piece :pos))))
       first))

;; It contains three steps, as we move the `R`ook from position `[0 0]` to `[0
;; 2]`. Each step includes the piece it applies to and a snapshot of the
;; board. The very first step is the initial board. Note that the last step also
;; records the capturing of a piece (a pawn).
;;
;; The idea of modeling moves as a list of steps will make sense when you dig
;; into the implementation the game-specific functions to expand the pmoves.

;; ---
;;
;; In the case of chess, the valid moves for a piece depend on its type. So we'd
;; like to have a way to code the move-generation logic independently for each
;; piece type. However, some of them share similar characteristics (moves on
;; diagonals, or orthogonal, cannot go over other pieces, captures opponent
;; pieces, etc.), so it'd be nice to code this "behaviors" separately and
;; combine them to model each one of the piece types.
;;

                  '[[[R - -] ;; Capturing the pawn
                     [- - -]

;; ## ********* DRAFT SKETCH NOTES *********

;; #### * TODO Automatically validate expected moves by comparing against an existing game engine
;; #### * TODO: Explain more about move generation (core primitives + game-specific rules)
;; #### * TODO: implement other games (TTT, checkers)
;; #### * TODO: implement game loop: to actually 'play'. Basically: "apply" moves to game stage

;; Just for kicks, let's start off the random board create above
(def a-random-game (core/start-game chess/chess-game a-random-board))

;; Get all possible moves:
